Once you are on the right page, you can start solving puzzles and competing with others. To answer the puzzles, click on the puzzle in progress and read the statement carefully. From there, retrieve the input data that will serve as input for your code. Each puzzle is divided into two parts: you must complete both parts before unlocking the next puzzle."
